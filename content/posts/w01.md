## aio-cli
aio-cli, is an extensible cli based on Open CLI Framework (OCLIF). This can be used to create, run, and manage Adobe Runtime serverless entities like **Packages**, **Actions**, **Triggers**, **Rules**, **APIs**, **Activations**, and **Property**. Each of these entities has subcommands like create , invoke etc.

## Installing CLI Tools

```js
npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
```
### Bootstrapping an application

```js
aio app init <app-name>
```
## Usage
* The available commands can be listed by executing the following:
    aio runtime
* Creating a runtime action
    aio runtime create <action name> <path to js or zip file>
* Retrieve an action:
    aio runtime action get <action name>
* Invoke an action: 
    aio runtime action invoke <action name> <optional parameters>
* Undeploy a manifest file: This command deletes the contents of the package listed in the manifest file. If no path to manifest file is provided, the command assumes there is a manifest.yaml or manifest.yml file in the current working directory.
    aio runtime deploy undeploy -m <path to manifest.yaml file>
## Publishing the App
    aio app deploy
This will invoke:

* The actions defined in manifest.yml being updated on Adobe I/O Runtime
* The frontend built files and assets being uploaded to our CDN.
The deployment outputs a URL of the app which is publicly accessible. It could also be "unpublished" later with aio app undeploy.
